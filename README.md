# ESPHome components for Nibe heat pumps

A ESPHome components that wraps the Arduino based udp gateway `NibeGW` up for use with ESPHome configuration.

## Background

When Modbus adapter support is enabled from the heat pump UI, the heat pump will start to send telegrams every now and then. A telegram contains a maximum of 20 registers. Those 20 registers can be configured via the Nibe ModbusManager application.

A telegram from the heat pump must be acknowledged, otherwise the heat pump will raise an alarm and go into the alarm state. Acknowledgement (ACK or NAK) responses should be sent correctly. This component will ACK/NAK and then forward received data to a configured UDP port on a remote host. It will also accept read/write requests on UDP to request other parameters.

## Setup

You will need an esp32 with some type of RS485 converter hooked up to a UART. It can either be a MAX485 based chip or a chip with automatic flow control like a MAX3485. If using an automatic flow controlling chip, set the `dir_pin` to an unused GPIO pin on your board.

### Configuration example

Add the following to a ESPHome configuration to enable the udp gateway feature to the device.

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: 
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/elupus/esphome-nibe.git
    components: [ nibegw ]

nibegw:
  dir_pin: GPIO4
  rx_pin: GPIO16
  tx_pin: GPIO17
  uart_id: 1
  udp:
    # The target address(s) to send data to. May be a multicast address.
    target:
      - ip: 192.168.16.130
        port: 10090

    # List of source address to accept data from, may be empty for no filter
    source:
      - 192.168.16.130

  acknowledge:
    - MODBUS40

  # Constant replies to certain requests can be made
  constants:
    - address: MODBUS40
      token: ACCESSORY
      data: [
            0x0A, # MODBUS version low
            0x00, # MODBUS version high
            0x02, # MODBUS address?
      ]
```

## Parsing

Currently no actual parsing of the payload is performed on the ESPHome device, this must be handled by external application.
