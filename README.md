# ESPHome components for Nibe heat pumps

An ESPHome component that wraps the Arduino based udp gateway `NibeGW` up, for use with ESPHome configuration.

## Background

When Modbus adapter support is enabled from the heat pump UI, the heat pump will start to send telegrams every now and then. A telegram contains a maximum of 20 registers. Those 20 registers can be configured via the Nibe ModbusManager application.

A telegram from the heat pump must be acknowledged, otherwise the heat pump will raise an alarm and go into the alarm state. Acknowledgement (ACK or NAK) responses should be sent correctly. This component will ACK/NAK and then forward received data to a configured UDP port on a remote host. It will also accept read/write requests on UDP to request other parameters.

## Setup

You will need an esp32 with some type of RS485 converter hooked up to a UART. It can either be a MAX485 based chip or a chip with automatic flow control like a MAX3485. If using an automatic flow controlling chip, don't set the `dir_pin`.

An example of such a board is the [LilyGo T-CAN485](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-CAN485), this board has an integrated RS485 connection that is verified to work with this setup. An example setup can be found in the [examples](./examples) folder.

Another board that should work but isn't tested is the [LILYGOÂ® T-RSC3 ESP32-C3](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-RSC3)

### Wifi power save mode
It is recommended to disable powersave mode on wifi, to make sure the device does not miss UDP requests sent.

```yaml
wifi:
  power_save_mode: none
```
### Sharing pins with logger
If you are using the same uart as used for the normal logger component, make sure to disable the logger's output to uart.

```yaml
logger:
  baudrate: 0
```

### Configuration example

Add the following to a ESPHome configuration to enable the udp gateway feature to the device.

Minimal Config

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: 
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/elupus/esphome-nibe.git
    components: [ nibegw ]

uart:
  rx_pin: GPIO16
  tx_pin: GPIO17
  baud_rate: 9600

nibegw:
  udp:
    target:
      - ip: 192.168.16.130

    source:
      - 192.168.16.130

  acknowledge:
    - MODBUS40
```

## Parsing

Currently no actual parsing of the payload is performed on the ESPHome device, this must be handled by external application.
